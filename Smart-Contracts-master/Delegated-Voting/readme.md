- The names of all the proposals need to be provided by the chairperson for the voting process to begin.
- Everyone need to register themselves by submitting their basic information (like name, age, and gender) in order to be considered for voting by the chairperson. People cannot change their information once they have updated. 
- Anyone who has not registered will not be able to vote, even if he/she is eligible. The eligible age is 18 (by default) and can be updated only by the chairperson. Once a person has registered, it is the choice of the chairperson, whether to give the voting rights to that person or not. The chairperson can only approve the voters who are eligible as well as registered. Chairperson can either choose to approve all the ready voters at once, or approve them one by one. 
- After a voter is approved, he/she can either vote for a particular proposal or delegate their voting power to some other approved voter. Once a voter has used his/her voting power to either vote or delegate their vote, they cannot vote/delegate again. 
- Chairperson also has rights to pass on their powers to some other person. 
- The winning proposal is chosen on the basis of maximum votes. No winning proposal can be decided in case of a draw. 
- The total number of people, the number of people who were approved to vote and the number of people who actually voted can also be calculated.
